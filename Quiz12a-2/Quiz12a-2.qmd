# Sitmulated

```{r}

set.seed(1)
years <- 2004:2023
hospital_names <- c('Hospital A', 'Hospital B', 'Hospital C', 'Hospital D', 'Hospital E')
n <- length(years) * length(hospital_names)

# Generate simulated data
data <- expand.grid(Year = years, HospitalName = hospital_names)
data$TotalDeaths <- sample(100:500, n, replace = TRUE)

# View the first few rows of the data

# calculating the total number of cancer deaths per year
